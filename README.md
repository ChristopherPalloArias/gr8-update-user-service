## Microservice Description

The `update-user-service` microservice is responsible for update the users in the +kotas App. Allows you to update users using an HTTP PUT request to the corresponding route.

### Starting the Server
Before starting the application you must change the database credentials in the index.js file if you want to use the application locally and independently, this is because initially the application is configured to be used in conjunction with the rest of Microservices.
